# Welcome to serverboi.org Github org üëã

Welcome to the **serverboi.org** Github organization - [serverboi.org](https://serverboi.org) is a personal project dedicated to full-stack web development. Started in 2020, this project began as a simple self-hosted WordPress blog where I shared software I wrote and my philosophical thoughts on it. It has continued and since evolved into a platform focused on creating and sharing detailed documentation for my software projects.
